\description{
Computes forecast combination weights using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.
}
\details{
The function integrates the ordinary least squares (OLS) forecast combination implementation of the
\emph{ForecastCombinations} package into ForecastComb.

The OLS combination method (Granger and Ramanathan (1984)) uses ordinary least squares to
estimate the weights, \eqn{\mathbf{w}^{OLS} = (w_1, \ldots, w_N)'}, as well as an intercept, \eqn{b}, for the combination of
the forecasts.

Suppose that there are \eqn{N} not perfectly collinear predictors  \eqn{\mathbf{f}_t = (f_{1t}, \ldots, f_{Nt})'},
then the forecast combination for one data point can be represented as:
\deqn{y_t = b + \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i f_{it}}

An appealing feature of the method is its bias correction through the intercept -- even if one or more of the individual
predictors are biased, the resulting combined forecast is unbiased. A disadvantage of the method is that it places no
restriction on the combination weights (i.e., they do not add up to 1 and can be negative), which can make interpretation
hard. Another issue, documented in Nowotarski et al. (2014), is the method's unstable behavior
when predictors are highly correlated (which is the norm in forecast combination): Minor fluctuations in the sample
can cause major shifts of the coefficient vector (\sQuote{bouncing betas}) -- often causing poor out-of-sample performance.
This issue is addressed by the \code{\link{comb_LAD}} method that is more robust to outliers.

The results are stored in an object of class 'foreccomb_res', for which separate plot and summary functions are provided.
