#' @title Ordinary Least Squares Forecast Combination
#'
#' @description Computes forecast combination weights using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.
#'
#' @details
#' The function integrates the ordinary least squares (OLS) forecast combination implementation of the
#' \emph{ForecastCombinations} package into ForecastComb.
#'
#' The OLS combination method (Granger and Ramanathan (1984)) uses ordinary least squares to
#' estimate the weights, \eqn{\mathbf{w}^{OLS} = (w_1, \ldots, w_N)'}, as well as an intercept, \eqn{b}, for the combination of
#' the forecasts.
#'
#' Suppose that there are \eqn{N} not perfectly collinear predictors  \eqn{\mathbf{f}_t = (f_{1t}, \ldots, f_{Nt})'},
#' then the forecast combination for one data point can be represented as:
#' \deqn{y_t = b + \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i f_{it}}
#'
#' An appealing feature of the method is its bias correction through the intercept -- even if one or more of the individual
#' predictors are biased, the resulting combined forecast is unbiased. A disadvantage of the method is that it places no
#' restriction on the combination weights (i.e., they do not add up to 1 and can be negative), which can make interpretation
#' hard. Another issue, documented in Nowotarski et al. (2014), is the method's unstable behavior
#' when predictors are highly correlated (which is the norm in forecast combination): Minor fluctuations in the sample
#' can cause major shifts of the coefficient vector (\sQuote{bouncing betas}) -- often causing poor out-of-sample performance.
#' This issue is addressed by the \code{\link{comb_LAD}} method that is more robust to outliers.
#'
#' The results are stored in an object of class 'foreccomb_res', for which separate plot and summary functions are provided.
#'
#' @param x An object of class 'foreccomb'. Contains training set (actual values + matrix of model forecasts) and optionally a test set.
#'
#' @return Returns an object of class \code{foreccomb_res} with the following components:
#' \item{Method}{Returns the best-fit forecast combination method.}
#' \item{Models}{Returns the individual input models that were used for the forecast combinations.}
#' \item{Weights}{Returns the combination weights obtained by applying the combination method to the training set.}
#' \item{Intercept}{Returns the intercept of the linear regression.}
#' \item{Fitted}{Returns the fitted values of the combination method for the training set.}
#' \item{Accuracy_Train}{Returns range of summary measures of the forecast accuracy for the training set.}
#' \item{Forecasts_Test}{Returns forecasts produced by the combination method for the test set. Only returned if input included a forecast matrix for the test set.}
#' \item{Accuracy_Test}{Returns range of summary measures of the forecast accuracy for the test set. Only returned if input included a forecast matrix and a vector of actual values for the test set.}
#' \item{Input_Data}{Returns the data forwarded to the method.}
